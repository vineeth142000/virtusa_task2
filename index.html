            The Department of Information Technology was started in the year 2001 with an initial intake of 60 B. Tech. students. Subsequently, the intake was increased to 180. The Department also offers an M.Tech. in Data Sciences with an intake of 18. The Department was accredited by NBA, AICTE in the year 2007 and reaccredited in the years 2013 and 2018. The Department is headed by Dr. Bipin Bihari Jayasingh.  All faculty members have an M. Tech. in Computer Science, with a minimum of about 4 years of teaching experience at the Assistant Professor level, which is an entry level requirement for recruitment to the department. The faculty consists of a good mix of individuals with industry and academic experience. The Department also has a high faculty retention rate.

The Department offers courses to the students of IT as well as some subjects of specialization to other departments. For First Year students of all branches of Engineering, the Department offers the subjects “Problem Solving through C”, “Data Structures through C”,  “IT Workshop Laboratory”.  The Department has expertise in the areas of Software Engineering, Real Time Systems, Databases, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, Distributed Systems, Scripting Languages, middleware technologies, Cloud Computing, Network Security, Big Data and IoT among various other subjects regularly offered by the Department.

The Department has eight laboratory units consisting of 260 systems, catering to the B. Tech curriculum. The systems use standard licensed software as a college policy including open source.  </p>

            The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the departments that started at the time of inception of CVR College of Engineering in 2001 with an intake of 60 B.Tech. students.  Expanding its horizons over the years, the department presently offers the B.Tech. program with an intake of 240, two M.Tech. programs with specializations in VLSI (intake 18), and Embedded Systems (intake 18), as well as Ph.D.  The department is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation.

The department has well-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories for Electronic Devices & Circuits, Pulse & Digital Circuits, IC&ECAD, Basic Simulation, Analog & Digital Communications, Digital Signal Processing, Microwave & Optical Communications, Microprocessors and Microcontrollers.  Advanced research laboratories include VLSI Center of Excellence, Embedded Systems and Advanced Wireless and Communication laboratories.  Software available includes latest versions of MATLAB with several tool boxes, CADENCE complete suit, Xilinx and Co-design tools to name a few.  The combined commercial value of all this software exceeds a million dollars. 

The strengths of the department are the specialized laboratoreis, senior professors, dynamic & young associate and assistant professors, industrious academic assistants, staff and meritorious students.
